# Changelog

Version bumps are classified by delivery scale; see `VERSIONING.md`.

## [1.16.6] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Instructor course builder quiz editor: added pasted-quiz import support for create and edit video-course flows, including JSON payloads, fenced JSON, and plain-text question/option input.

### Fixed

- Instructor quiz paste/import parsing: normalized smart quotes and trailing commas for JSON-like input, resolved plain-text answer hints by option text, letter, or number, and fixed numbered-question parsing so numbered options are not misclassified as new questions.

### Verification

- `npm test -- --run src/utils/quizUtils.spec.js`
- `npm run build`

---

## [1.16.5] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- Resource progress synchronization: local anonymous progress is now preserved and only cleared after background sync POSTs have settled; optimistic updates from post-login flows are preserved during the merge. `toggleWeek` and `updateNotes` now compute and persist state from the latest committed store to avoid stale-closure races.
- Admin external resource editor: improved AI autofill and "Paste JSON" flows, more robust localized label initialization, and better category suggestion handling when creating or editing resources.
- External resource details and dashboard widgets: restored provider line and free-price pill rendering, fixed progress-percent calculation and ensured API-backed data is used instead of stale static fixtures when navigating between pages.
- Certificate upload: uploaded certificate URLs are now saved and surfaced correctly in progress entries.
- Miscellaneous defensive error handling and UI clarity fixes across external-resources flows.

### Verification

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- Dashboard → Free Resources: verify save/start/complete flows, study-plan toggles, notes persistence, and AI companion tabs behave as expected.

---

## [1.16.4] - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- Admin external resource editing now stores `priceLabel`, `durationLabel`, and `certificateLabel` as localized `ky` / `en` / `ru` objects instead of single strings, with per-language inputs in the basic metadata form.
- Existing legacy string label values are normalized when an external resource is reopened in admin, so older resources can be re-saved into the new localized shape without backend changes.

### Fixed

- External resource cards now show the provider line again and restore the free-price pill that disappeared during the previous card redesign.
- External resource detail pages now show price, level, duration, certificate, and certificate-cost metadata again inside both the mobile action card and the desktop sidebar.
- Admin external resource list rows now resolve localized price labels correctly instead of rendering raw label objects once localized metadata is saved.

### Verification

- `npm run build`
- Admin → External Resources: create and edit resources through manual entry, AI autofill, and pasted JSON; verify localized label fields save and re-open correctly.
- `/resources` and resource detail pages: verify restored metadata is visible on cards, mobile action panels, and desktop sidebars.

---

## [1.16.3] - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- External resource cards redesigned across home, courses, and `/resources` with a stronger hero image treatment, clearer metadata grouping, and a heavier CTA row aligned to the new visual direction.
- `ExternalResourceDetails.jsx` refreshed as part of the same external-resources UI pass, including updated iconography, cleaner CTAs, improved section hierarchy, and tighter desktop sidebar layout.
- `/resources` category pills now derive from actual resource categories returned by the catalog instead of a hard-coded frontend list.
- Admin external resource modal now accepts freeform category keys with existing-category suggestions, so new categories can be created without a code change.

### Fixed

- Homepage and courses featured-resource sections were treating `fetchExternalResources()` as an array, causing external courses to disappear when the API returned `{ data, total }`.
- Dynamic category pill labels could render as `[object Object]` because the normalized category helper wrapped the `all` option with an extra object layer.
- Added missing public locale labels for `english`, `business`, and `cloud` categories in `ky`, `en`, and `ru` so dynamic pills resolve to translated labels for known categories.

### Verification

- `npm run build`
- Homepage: verify featured external resources render again.
- `/resources`: verify pills are generated from available categories and new admin-created categories appear automatically.
- Resource detail page: verify refreshed layout, CTA behavior, and responsive sidebar rendering.

---

## [1.16.2] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- AI companion in `ResourceDetailPanel` reorganised into a 3-tab layout: **Study Plan**, **Explain**, **Practice** — previously all three tools were stacked vertically in one scrollable block.
- Save button for AI explanations (`💾 Save explanation`) — previously only study plan and practice tasks had save buttons; explanation results were auto-saved and could not be explicitly committed.
- Per-tab save labels: `aiConceptSave`/`aiConceptSaved`, `aiTasksSave`/`aiTasksSaved` added to `ky`, `en`, `ru` public locale files (previously all three tabs shared the generic "Save plan" / "Plan saved" strings).
- Inline confirmation for "Remove from my list": first click shows "Remove this course from your list? [Yes, remove] [Cancel]" — no accidental single-click removal. Confirmation state is also wired in `ExternalResourceDetails.jsx`.
- `removeConfirm`, `removeConfirmYes`, `removeConfirmCancel` keys added to `ky`, `en`, `ru` student and public locale files.

### Changed

- "Remove from plan" button relocated from the bottom of `ResourceDetailPanel` to the **top-right of the title block** as a subtle trash icon — removes ambiguity with the AI-generated study plan below.
- "Remove from plan" relabelled to **"Remove from my list"** (`removeFromPlan` key updated in all six locale files) — the old label was confused with "remove AI study plan content".
- Explain tab pills now **load cached explanations from `aiCache.explanations[title]`** on click (same pattern as Study Plan tab) and highlight the active pill — previously clicking a pill cleared the current result and did not restore a previously saved explanation.
- Practice Tasks pills are now **always visible** regardless of whether tasks are currently shown — previously pills were hidden behind a `!practiceTasks` guard, making it impossible to switch topics after generating tasks.

### Fixed

- `FreeResourcesTab.jsx` and `ExternalResourcesHomeSection.jsx` were reading featured resources from the static JS data file instead of the API, bypassing `isPublished` filtering and potentially showing draft resources.
- `FreeResourcesWidget.jsx` was computing progress-bar percentage from `studyPlan.length` via the static file — replaced with `entry.progressPercent` from the API.
- `ExternalResourceDetails.jsx` was initialising resource state from `getResourceBySlug()` (static file) before the API fetch completed — now starts as `null` with a loading state so no stale data is shown.
- `FreeResourcesTab.jsx:646` runtime `ReferenceError: getResourceBySlug is not defined` — a second usage in the list-panel render was missed when the static import was removed; replaced with `entry.progressPercent`.
- `FreeResourcesTab.jsx` and `ExternalResourceDetails.jsx` were not making API calls when navigated to from the course details page — `fetchExternalResourceBySlug` is now called inside a `useEffect` on slug change.
- CS50: Introduction to Computer Science removed from `externalResources.js` static data; `relatedCourseSlugs` references in `cs50-ai-with-python` and `freecodecamp-python-scientific-computing` cleared.

### Verification

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- Dashboard → Free Resources tab: select a saved resource → AI companion tabs function independently; switching Explain pills loads cached explanations; switching Practice pills loads cached tasks; pills remain visible after generation.
- "Remove from my list" trash icon in title block → inline confirmation appears → confirm removes entry; cancel dismisses.

---

## [1.16.1] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Admin resource modal: "Paste JSON" fill mode alongside the existing AI Autofill (URL) strip — admin can paste AI-generated JSON (from a prompt template) to populate all form fields and multilingual content in one action.
- Prompt template provided for generating correctly-shaped JSON from any external AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).

### Changed

- Admin resource modal autofill strip refactored: `applyResourceData` helper shared between URL-based AI autofill and the new JSON paste fill path.

### Fixed

- `ResourceProgressProvider`: anonymous progress entries in `localStorage` were cleared before their API sync calls settled — `Promise.allSettled` now waits for all upserts before clearing the anon key.
- `ResourceProgressProvider`: optimistic updates (e.g. `saveResource` from `postLogin`) were overwritten when the initial `GET /external-resources/my` response arrived — functional `setStore` updater now merges API state with any concurrent local changes.
- `ResourceProgressProvider`: `toggleWeek` read `checkedWeeks` from a stale closure — computation moved inside the `mutate` updater so rapid toggles on different weeks each read the latest committed state.
- `ResourceProgressProvider`: `updateNotes` fired an API call on every keystroke — calls now debounced at 600 ms.
- `ResourceProgressProvider`: `removeResource` deleted the local entry but never called the backend — now calls `DELETE /external-resources/:slug/progress`.
- `ExternalResourceDetails`: Save/Start/enrolled CTAs flickered during the initial progress fetch — `progressLoading` guard added with an animated skeleton placeholder.
- `postLogin.js`: `save-resource` pending action bypassed `ResourceProgressContext` and called the API directly, losing the optimistic update — now invokes `saveResource` from context via a new `saveResource` param on `executePendingAuthAction`.
- `api.js` (`upsertExternalResourceProgress`): `aiCache` payload field was silently dropped — added to destructure and POST body.
- `CourseDetails.jsx`: `linkedResources ?? staticResources` passed through an empty array and suppressed the static fallback — changed to `linkedResources?.length ? linkedResources : staticResources`.
- `CourseDetails.jsx`: stale linked resources briefly visible when navigating between courses — `setLinkedResources(null)` now fires before each new fetch.
- Backend (`external-resources.service.ts`): study-plan generation tracked the wrong event type (`viewed`) — added `ai_plan_generated` event type and updated the service.

### Verification

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- Admin: open "Add resource" modal → "Paste JSON" tab → paste generated JSON → verify all fields populate correctly

---

## [1.16.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- External free-learning feature: homepage section, `/resources` listing, and `/resources/:slug` detail guide pages with dedicated components and responsive UI.
- Static curated catalog and data file for initial launch (multilingual content: ky/en/ru) and translation keys for UI copy.
- Auth prompt for EduBot-owned actions and localStorage-backed save/start/progress hooks for MVP behavior.
- Dashboard widget showing saved/started external resources for logged-in users.
- Backend support: `external_resources` and `user_external_resource_progress` migrations, public `GET /external-resources` and `GET /external-resources/:slug`, user progress APIs (`POST/PATCH /external-resources/:slug/progress`), seed script, and sitemap integration.
- Admin tooling: admin endpoints and UI for creating/editing resources, `isPublished`/`isFeatured` toggles, and resource-to-course linking.
- Analytics and tracking events for resource views, saves, starts, official-link clicks, and completions.
- AI companion endpoint for generating personalized study plans and Kyrgyz-language explainers.
- Redirect proxy endpoint (`/resources/:slug/go`) to log official-link clicks before redirecting.

### Changed

- Integrated external resources into course pages and home marketing sections; added i18n coverage and content-fallback helpers.
- Primary MVP CTAs adjusted to avoid promising backend-only features before Phase 4; study-group CTA recommended until full tracking exists.

### Verification

- `npm run test`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run audit:localization`
- `npm run build`
- Backend: run migrations and verify `GET /external-resources` and `GET /external-resources/:slug` return expected data

- `npm run build`
- `git diff --check`

---

## [1.15.1] - 2026-06-01

### Verification

- `npm run build`

---

## [1.14.1] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- Restored main-app student access to enrolled video course lessons when the legacy enrollment check returns false but the student portal course list confirms active course access.
- Kept public course details behavior unchanged while adding a student-only access fallback before lesson sections are locked.

### Verification

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `git diff --check`

---

## [1.14.0] - 2026-05-24

### Changed

- Removed the main-app admin integration and attendance tabs, including stale dashboard tab constants, so admin navigation matches the supported platform management surface.
- Simplified the main-app assistant dashboard to operate outside tenant context, removing tenant selection state while keeping student, course, enrollment, and attendance workspace views available for main-app assistants.
- Restricted company management routes to main platform admins while preserving superadmin access through the existing admin-compatible role check.
- Added explicit tenant scope support for enrollment API calls and admin analytics filters without injecting tenant headers globally into the main app.
- Split Vite production chunks by app locale, React/vendor groups, charts, media, icons, and sanitizer code so release builds no longer emit large chunk warnings.

### Fixed

- Removed stale assistant tenant-access localization coverage after tenant dashboard selection was removed from the main app assistant surface.

---

## [1.13.12] - 2026-05-21

### Changed

- Hardened frontend/backend localization error handling so API errors now resolve `messageKey`/`labelKey`, top-level `errorCode`, exact known codes, and localized category fallbacks before falling back to generic copy.
- Extended backend error fallback coverage for broad code families including auth, tenant/company, course, lesson, media, AI, enrollment, attendance, certificate, CRM integration, groups/sessions, homework, student, notification, and leaderboard.
- Updated localization QA documentation to mark the frontend/backend connection layer as release-ready while keeping exact per-code translations as incremental backlog.

### Fixed

- Replaced instructor and student chat recovery checks against the backend English text `Chat not found` with stable backend error-code checks.
- Prevented public contact form field validation from rendering backend prose directly; field errors now prefer backend keys/codes and otherwise use localized frontend validation copy.
- Strengthened the localization audit to catch direct backend `message`/`error` rendering and exact backend prose comparisons in production source.

### Verification

- `npm run audit:localization -- --fail-on-findings`

## [1.13.9] - 2026-05-21

### Changed

- Completed the frontend localization release across public, dashboard, attendance, course, instructor, assistant, integration, certificate, and shared UI surfaces for `ky`, `ru`, and `en`.
- Centralized enum/status/option label rendering so backend machine values remain stable while visible labels resolve through translation keys.
- Added `npm run audit:localization` to catch hardcoded production UI copy, direct backend message rendering, Cyrillic/Kyrgyz source literals, and missing static translation keys.
- Updated the frontend localization plan with completed LOC-001 through LOC-007 work and remaining QA guidance.

### Fixed

- Removed tenant locale fallback from main app UI locale resolution so tenant configuration no longer decides the platform language.
- Aligned forgot-password, post-login, and course-detail runtime translation namespaces with the shipped locale resources.
- Replaced direct backend-message fallbacks with shared localized API error parsing in localized UI paths.
- Corrected Kyrgyz product terminology and morphology for `студент`, `инструктор`, `группа`, and `панель` usage.

- Localized the session attendance workspace for `ky`, `ru`, and `en`, including course/group/session filters, view toggles, metrics, status labels, notices, empty states, admin edit controls, load/save feedback, and active-language session date formatting.
- Added shared translation namespaces for course builder, course learning quiz/challenge playback, and attendance strings across all supported locales.
- Updated course builder validation helpers and curriculum statistics to resolve messages through the active translation function.

### Fixed

- Prevented active-language changes from refetching and resetting unsaved attendance edits.
- Prevented active-language changes from rehydrating and overwriting unsaved course builder state.
- Localized the course builder skill placeholder after skills load and refresh, instead of falling back to the Kyrgyz default in other languages.
- Wired the lesson preview-video checkbox in the curriculum asset panel so toggling it no longer calls an undefined handler.

- Localized the group-session resources tab, including material management, link/file/video actions, live meeting and recording panels, integration tools, course video reuse library, delete confirmation, and video preview loading copy for `ky`, `ru`, and `en`.

### Fixed

- Fixed the group-session homework modal portal import so opening the homework modal no longer crashes with `createPortal is not a function`.
- Fixed localized group-session helper fallbacks so homework dates, uploaded answer text, attachment labels, workspace tab labels, course type labels, and 401/403 workspace errors follow the active UI language.
- Fixed group-session activity submission timestamps so saved-at dates use the active UI language instead of the browser default locale.
- Fixed course-video reuse section expansion state so translated fallback section labels no longer reset expanded sections after a language change.

- Localized instructor delivery-course creation feedback and profile load/save toasts for `ky`, `ru`, and `en`.

### Fixed

- Fixed student chat attachment forwarding so `ChatWorkspace` passes file type and file data to the send handler in the expected order.
- Fixed localized student course, schedule, and resource session dates so unknown-time fallbacks and date formatting follow the active language.
- Hardened instructor group/enrollment modals so missing or wrapped student option payloads do not crash individual-course creation or offering enrollment.
- Removed duplicate success/error handling from the offering create/edit modal so the parent offering workflow remains the single source for save feedback.
- Hardened instructor offering management so wrapped course/offering payloads and missing enrollment dropdown state do not break offering filtering or student search.
- Hardened instructor course and student management hooks so wrapped course/student response payloads do not clear valid lists.
- Hardened instructor delivery-course category loading so wrapped category response payloads still populate the create/edit modal.

- Localized shared analytics loading/empty/error states, setup-account copy, skip navigation labels, generic progress labels, student dashboard course-opening toasts, and shared video fallback states.
- Updated the frontend localization plan with the completed admin/shared surfaces and remaining dashboard/internal gaps.

### Fixed

- Prevented duplicate user notifications by keeping category, user, and enrollment API helpers data-only while leaving localized success/error toasts in the caller/domain layers.

## [1.10.3] - 2026-05-12

Patch release for post-`1.10.2` UX/UI audit improvements.

### Fixed

- Tightened `AdvancedModal` action handling so loading or disabled actions cannot be triggered by click or keyboard shortcuts.
- Improved the Contact form submission state and validation wiring so duplicate sends are blocked and field errors are associated with their inputs.
- Improved Contact page support cues, phone guidance, contact-method cards, and map/address actions for clearer lead-generation flow.
- Reworked the Contact page desktop composition so the supporting illustration becomes a useful next-step panel while the form remains primary.
- Removed the redundant Contact page `Toaster` now that app-level toast handling is centralized.
- Split the Contact page into smaller local presentational sections for the intro, form, support panel, contact methods, and location block.
- Reused the shared `PhoneInput` on the Contact page and expanded it to support ids, names, ARIA/error wiring, custom classes, and stricter digit-only cases.
- Improved Contact submission error handling so backend field errors can be displayed inline instead of only showing a generic toast.
- Aligned Contact phone validation with the international format used by registration.
- Aligned Contact email validation with auth forms so valid longer top-level domains are accepted.
- Reworked the Unauthorized page into a clearer access-control state with role-aware recovery actions, support guidance, and focus handling.
- Centralized `/chat` communication routing so student/instructor chat tabs, admin notifications, assistant dashboard fallback, and visible unsupported-role fallback use one shared rule.
- Improved Login form validation, field accessibility, forgot-password trigger semantics, pending-action copy, and post-login routing back to the intended protected destination or role dashboard.
- Removed duplicate global pending-action execution after login/register to prevent repeated cart or favourite actions.
- Fixed post-login redirects from auth modals that pass string `from` paths so users return to the intended page instead of the role dashboard.
- Extracted post-login pending cart/favourite recovery into a dedicated auth utility and redesigned forgot-password recovery with validation, dialog semantics, and clearer copy.
- Preserved full course card data for deferred favourite/cart actions so post-login optimistic cards keep image, price, instructor, and metadata.
- Fixed the course detail video card favourite action so authenticated users can add or remove favourites without being sent through the login modal.
- Preserved guest cart storage on initial unauthenticated load while still clearing cart state after an authenticated logout.
- Improved the Home hero carousel accessibility with labels, hidden inactive slides, labelled indicators, `aria-current`, and consistent primary/secondary CTA destinations.
- Added visible loading, empty, and error states for Home top courses, top instructors, and feedback sections.
- Replaced Feedback image arrows with semantic carousel buttons and added FAQ accordion ARIA relationships.
- Added incremental loading to the public Courses catalog and clarified catalog/course-card availability language for video vs assigned live/offline courses.
- Polished About metrics responsiveness, fixed the malformed metric color class, and gave the team image meaningful alt text.
- Reworked the About page into a clearer brand narrative with consistent containers, tighter responsive typography, distinct proof/vision/principles sections, and removed orphaned About variants.
- Added stronger `DefaultLabel` accessibility wiring and `LabelPassword` autocomplete support for auth forms.
- Improved Register validation, field-level errors, focus-only password guidance, phone help text, and post-registration routing through the shared auth success helper.
- Simplified shared auth inputs to behave as controlled components instead of mirroring local input state.
- Debounced global course search and added loading, error, empty, Escape, and ARIA states for desktop and mobile search.
- Guarded global course search against stale responses overriding newer query results.
- Replaced the Footer runtime QR service with a verified local QR PNG and normalized footer contact/address/copyright copy.

- Added optional title, description, active-filter count, clear action, and action slot support to `DashboardFilterBar`.
- Added a centralized role-aware navigation helper for dashboard, notification, course, cart, favourites, and chat destinations.
- Added stable dashboard navigation data hooks for keyboard shortcuts and sidebar arrow navigation.

### Changed

- Improved header overlays so route changes, outside clicks, and `Escape` close menus/search predictably.
- Standardized `BasicModal` header/body spacing to avoid oversized double padding.
- Consolidated legacy `src/components/ui/Button.jsx` exports around the shared button primitive and removed duplicate animated button styling.
- Reduced dashboard sidebar visual noise, removed hover scaling, and added an explicit collapse/expand control.
- Updated dashboard keyboard shortcuts to target the current semantic navigation model instead of removed ARIA menu roles.
- Simplified the authenticated user dropdown layout, removed rigid widths, and aligned menu labels.

### Fixed

- Fixed dashboard sidebar layout after adding the collapse control by keeping the sidebar shell vertical even when parent layouts pass flex display classes.
- Fixed role-aware user menu destinations so instructor/admin/assistant course links use valid tabs and unsupported assistant notification links are omitted.
- Fixed destructive confirmation modals so confirm actions cannot be triggered repeatedly while the request is running.
- Fixed assistant dashboard navigation helpers and URL tab syncing to support the assistant overview, courses, attendance, and enrollments tabs.

### Audit Tracking

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-03

### 🚀 DELIVERY BATCH

- Released the full session-workspace delivery batch as a minor version because it adds multiple backward-compatible capabilities across instructor and student workflows.
- Consolidated the recent session-related work into a coherent release line covering group schedule defaults, explicit session generation, session activities, student dashboard truthfulness, and backend-backed session insights.

### 🧭 SESSION WORKSPACE + GROUP DELIVERY

- Added reusable group schedule defaults in create/edit group and an explicit preview-first `Сессияларды түзүү` flow for delivery groups.
- Reworked the instructor session workspace into a real operational surface with session-owned attendance, resources, homework, activities, notes, and insights.
- Added backend-backed `Кийинки аракеттер` with actionable attendance/homework/activity signals, prioritization, and drill-down routing into the right workspace tabs.

### 🧑‍🎓 STUDENT EXPERIENCE

- Rebuilt the student dashboard around truthful modality-aware learning signals instead of synthetic gamification.
- Added a real student `Ресурстар` workflow and strengthened the homework/activity/review loop so students can see current state, history, and teacher feedback more clearly.

### 🧩 SESSION ACTIVITIES

- Added a normalized session-activity domain, per-activity instructor CRUD, quiz authoring, student task execution, instructor review, and status-driven visibility.
- Extended non-quiz activities into a threaded review/submission model so student and instructor exchanges persist as history instead of overwriting each other.

### ✅ RELEASE STATUS

- Frontend production build passes for the full `1.5.0` delivery batch.

## [1.4.6] - 2026-04-03

### 🧩 SESSION ACTIVITIES INTERACTION

- Extended session activities from authoring-only into a full instructor/student workflow with student task execution, instructor review, and status-driven access for non-quiz activities and quizzes.
- Added threaded non-quiz activity history so student replies and instructor reviews are preserved as a conversation instead of overwriting the previous exchange.
- Split student activity UX more clearly between `Ресурстар` for session context and `Тапшырмалар` for actual action, including stronger handoff copy and state-driven quiz action labels such as `Квизди баштоо` and `Квизди кайра тапшыруу`.
- Reworked instructor `Иштер` responses into clearer current-state plus history views with denser filters, localized review statuses, and read/edit separation for saved reviews.

### 🛠️ REVIEW + SUBMISSION HARDENING

- Hardened activity review rules so reviewed discussion/exercise/group-work responses require real feedback, and aligned review validation more closely with the homework review model.
- Made student and instructor non-quiz submission/review writes transactional so latest submission state and thread history stay in sync.
- Added explicit student attachment-removal behavior for non-quiz resubmissions instead of silently preserving older files.
- Limited student submission attachments for both activities and homework to PDF/Word files only, with matching backend validation and frontend picker/error copy.
- Clarified current-vs-history rendering by exposing latest submission/review and prior history separately instead of making frontend tabs infer that split from raw message arrays.

### ✅ BUILD STATUS

- Production build passes after the threaded activity interaction and review-hardening checkpoint.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-04-02

### 🧩 SESSION ACTIVITIES

- Added a real instructor `Иштер` tab in the session workspace with read-first cards, per-activity create/edit/delete flows, and separate save behavior instead of saving the full activity list at once.
- Added structured session activities with support for `Талкуу`, `Көнүгүү`, `Квиз`, and `Топтук иш`, including quiz questions, multiple-choice options, and explicit single-choice vs multi-choice authoring.
- Reworked activity authoring so quiz editing has clearer internal hierarchy, collapsible question editing, and stronger status guidance about what students can or cannot see.
- Made student `Ресурстар` reflect session activities from the same session source of truth, with view-only activity cards, clearer type/status cues, and student-safe visibility for `active` and `done` activities only.

### 🛠️ UX FIXES

- Fixed activity-title typing/focus loss caused by unstable list keys in the session activities editor.
- Corrected instructor activity summary metrics so `Көрүнөт` now matches the actual student visibility rule.
- Made quiz answer-mode switching safer by preserving one valid correct answer when changing a question back to single-choice.

### ✅ BUILD STATUS

- Production build passes after the session activities authoring/sync checkpoint.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-04-02

### 🗓️ GROUP SCHEDULE DEFAULTS

- Added weekly default schedule support to instructor group create/edit so delivery groups can persist a reusable planning template with `scheduleNote` and structured weekday/time blocks.
- Reworked the group create/edit modal to treat weekly schedule defaults as a dedicated planning section instead of burying them among the core metadata fields.
- Added saved default-schedule visibility on group cards so instructors can see at a glance whether a group already has a reusable weekly plan.
- Autofilled new delivery groups with the selected course instructor and a default timezone to reduce repetitive admin work during group creation.

### 🧭 SESSION GENERATION FLOW

- Added an explicit preview-first `Сессияларды түзүү` flow from group cards so instructors can pick a date range, inspect which sessions are new versus already present, and only then create the missing sessions.
- Grouped generated-session preview rows by date and clarified the step sequence inside the generation modal so the workflow reads as plan -> preview -> create.
- Promoted `Сессия түзүү` as the main next-step action on delivery-group cards while keeping `Студент кошуу` and `Өзгөртүү` secondary.
- Hardened the generation modal so stale preview responses no longer overwrite a newer date range after the user changes the form.

### 🛠️ UX FIXES

- Fixed dashboard skeleton list/card key warnings caused by placeholder loops without stable keys.
- Raised group-related modals above the dashboard chrome so create/edit, enroll, and session-generation modals no longer render under the app header.
- Improved default-schedule card rendering so all saved weekday/time blocks display with equal visual weight instead of promoting the first block above the others.

- Reworked student `Прогресс` to focus on real course progress, completed lessons, certificates, continue-learning, and delivery-mode-specific context instead of decorative gamification metrics.
- Folded the useful student analytics content into `Прогресс` as an embedded advanced-progress section so the dashboard no longer feels like two separate student products.
- Removed the old standalone student analytics tab path from the active dashboard IA and redirected `/student/analytics` into `Прогресс`.
- Simplified student `Рейтинг` into a lighter secondary companion with calmer top-level structure and clearer track labels aligned to student language.

### 🧭 STUDENT DASHBOARD HARDENING

- Removed dead overview leaderboard-preview loading so the student overview no longer makes an unnecessary weekly leaderboard request.
- Tightened student advanced-progress behavior by removing the old cross-role swipe navigation pattern from the embedded/standalone analytics surface.
- Stopped overstating group-scoped precision in embedded student progress analytics; advanced progress now presents honest course-scoped context where the backend model is truly course-based.

### ✅ BUILD STATUS

- Production build passes after the student overview/progress/truthfulness cleanup.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-02

### 🧑‍🎓 STUDENT DASHBOARD ALIGNMENT

- Added a dedicated student `Ресурстар` tab backed by a session-safe read model so learners can find materials, recordings, live join info, location, and instructor context without relying on schedule cards alone.
- Reworked student resource access around protected preview flows, including same-page preview modals for materials, recordings, and homework attachments with backend-controlled access instead of exposing raw storage URLs in the normal UI path.
- Changed student `Resources` to a one-session-at-a-time workflow with a session picker, quick session chips, and focused session context instead of a mixed archive list.
- Upgraded student task cards to show the real homework review loop, including `Бекитилди`, `Оңдотуу керек`, and `Кайтарылды` states plus teacher comment, score, reviewed time, latest submission context, and resubmission-friendly copy.
- Made student homework submit flow refresh from backend after save so task cards reflect the true reviewed/submitted state instead of local optimistic status only.
- Aligned student schedule with the session-first model by using `liveJoinUrl`, removing the misleading `Видео` filter, normalizing session/course/group/instructor display, and keeping the live side panel in sync with active list filters.
- Hardened student access gating so overview load failures no longer masquerade as “no active access,” and isolated optional leaderboard failures from the rest of the overview state.

### 🧭 INSTRUCTOR SESSION WORKSPACE

- Reworked the instructor session workspace around a clearer course -> group -> session flow with a stronger session picker and sticky active-session bar.
- Removed session-level chat from the workspace and moved session create/edit into a dedicated modal instead of keeping setup controls in the main teaching canvas.
- Scoped the quick-switch strip to `Тандалган группанын бүгүнкү сессиялары` so it now reflects only today’s sessions for the selected group.
- Extracted the oversized session workspace into dedicated feature components for attendance, homework, resources, notes, engagement, and session setup.
- Restored session notes as a real persisted session feature instead of a local-only draft textarea.
- Reframed the old engagement surface into `Кийинки аракеттер` so the tab now shows real follow-up signals instead of mock badges and arbitrary XP.
- Removed the extra right-side session summary card to reduce duplicate context and keep the workspace focused on the active tab.

### ✅ ATTENDANCE WORKFLOW

- Upgraded session attendance with search, status filters, bulk actions, and clearer saved/unsaved state feedback.
- Tightened course/group/session selector chaining so downstream selections clear predictably and stale session context no longer lingers during reloads.
- Aligned session attendance fully to a session-first workflow: students now start as `Белгилене элек`, attendance is blocked until a session is selected, and session switching no longer leaks the previous session’s marked statuses.
- Scoped session attendance history to the selected group so session-derived summaries and engagement signals no longer read from unrelated groups in the same course.
- Moved Zoom attendance import into the attendance action bar and show it only for Zoom-backed `online_live` sessions with an attached meeting.
- Simplified the attendance marking surface into a denser list layout, removed streak/history from the row UI, added a reset action for the filtered set, and clarified summary counts with explicit `Уруксат менен` and `Белгилене элек` states.

### 📎 RESOURCES + SESSION MATERIALS

- Rebuilt the session `Resources` tab into a clearer teacher workflow for materials, live meeting state, recording access, and integration utilities.
- Added direct session material management with link creation, real file upload, inline rename/edit, delete confirmation modal, and calmer row-level actions.
- Added session material video preview using the shared player in a lazy-loaded modal instead of exposing raw signed URLs in the list.
- Added reuse of lesson videos from the instructor’s published video courses into offline and online-live session materials through a dedicated picker flow.
- Stopped showing raw meeting and recording URLs in the visible UI, replacing them with clearer state-based controls and copy/open actions.
- Stopped using group meeting URLs as a session-workspace fallback so `Join Class` and meeting actions now reflect only the selected session’s own live state.

### 📚 HOMEWORK QUEUE + REVIEW

- Repositioned instructor homework into a real triage board with queue-first cards, action-required emphasis, clickable summary metrics, and deep links into the exact session homework context.
- Reworked session homework review around a full assigned roster so instructors can now see `Текшерүү керек`, `Жөнөткөн жок`, `Оңдотуу керек`, and `Кеч тапшырган` states in one place instead of submissions only.
- Added URL-backed session homework review filters and dashboard-to-session homework navigation that preserves the targeted course, group, session, homework, and review state.
- Simplified the session homework layout to reduce card overlap, overflow, and badge collisions across publish, list, and review areas.
- Added in-page homework attachment preview in a modal for previewable files with backend-served blobs and a fallback download action for unsupported file types.
- Added comment-based homework review actions so `Оңдотуу` and `Кайтаруу` now collect instructor feedback before saving, while approved responses can keep optional feedback.
- Hardened homework review UX so failed saves keep the review modal open, attachment preview failures surface visible feedback, and review comments remain visible on the submission row after save.

### 🛠️ UX FIXES

- Fixed session setup modal behavior with proper portal rendering, background scroll lock, keyboard handling, and safer context copy for create vs edit flows.
- Renamed the frontend session API feature surface from `courseSessions` to `groupSessions` to match the group-owned session model.
- Fixed stale homework submission requests when switching to a newly created or newly selected session.
- Improved auto-generated session index suggestions to use the actual max session number in the selected group.
- Applied delivery-mode-aware UI rules so live-only actions and meeting controls no longer appear for offline session contexts.
- Added stronger notes save confidence with explicit unsaved/saved-empty states and note-specific last-saved feedback.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-22

### Changed

- Student dashboard leaderboard visuals now use an embedded variant aligned with the dashboard shell instead of the public leaderboard styling.
- Student achievement sharing copy now makes it clear when a user is sharing a real achievement versus a public sample card.
- Skills leaderboard now uses the backend `/skills` catalog as the source of truth instead of frontend-injected default skills.

### Fixed

- Fixed mobile clipping and wrapping issues in leaderboard spotlight and student-of-week cards.
- Fixed student dashboard tab syncing so dashboard navigation no longer snaps back to the leaderboard tab.
- Fixed mobile dashboard access by adding a mobile section switcher and clearer dashboard entry points from the header sidebar.
- Fixed homepage “Top learners” to render only the top 3 cards.
- Removed misleading fallback labels like `React Leader` from the homepage leaderboard cards.
- Fixed broken achievement card layout in the student dashboard sidebar column.
- Restricted unauthenticated achievement sharing to public/sample actions only.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-03-21

### Added

- Public leaderboard product surface with clearer Kyrgyz messaging, social proof metrics, value proposition blocks, and stronger CTA placement.
- Student leaderboard hub with personal summary, near-you ranking, challenge rail, skills spotlight, achievements wall, and share-focused interactions.
- Share modal with explicit channels for Telegram, WhatsApp, X, LinkedIn, copy-link, PNG download, and native share fallback.
- Frontend regression tests for leaderboard hub and share experience via Vitest.
- Release notes for leaderboard v2 in `docs/shared/releases/LEADERBOARD_V2_RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

### Changed

- Public leaderboard now avoids authenticated endpoints and only uses public-safe loading flows.
- Kyrgyz copy across leaderboard, skills, achievements, and sharing surfaces was tightened and made more product-oriented.
- Challenge cards now consume backend-provided action metadata instead of relying only on frontend heuristics.
- Skill challenge routing now opens the relevant leaderboard skill context directly.
- Share cards and public share landing flow were refined for clearer UX and better social publishing behavior.

### Fixed

- Removed fabricated leaderboard fallback data from student/public views and replaced it with explicit empty/error states.
- Fixed clipped share modal rendering by moving modal rendering through the shared portal flow.
- Fixed unauthenticated share behavior on public leaderboard surfaces.
- Fixed unstable achievement card CTA layout and mobile wrapping behavior.

### 🎯 MAJOR REFACTORING: SHARED COURSE BUILDER ARCHITECTURE

### 📋 OVERVIEW

Complete refactoring of course builder components to use shared architecture, enabling code reuse and consistency between create and edit modes.

### 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE CHANGES

- **Shared Components**: Created unified CourseInfoStep, CurriculumStep, PreviewStep components
- **Centralized Hook**: `useCourseBuilder` with mode-aware logic for create/edit operations
- **Consistent Validation**: Unified validation system across all course builder steps
- **Mode Flexibility**: Same components work for both create and edit modes

### 📦 COMPONENTS CREATED

- **CreateCourseRefactor.jsx**: Refactored create course using shared architecture
- **EditInstructorCourseRefactor.jsx**: Refactored edit course using shared architecture
- **useCourseBuilder.js**: Centralized state management and API operations
- **CourseInfoStep.jsx**: Shared component for course information (Step 1)
- **CurriculumStep.jsx**: Shared component for curriculum management (Step 2)
- **PreviewStep.jsx**: Shared component for course preview (Step 3)

### 🎯 KEY IMPROVEMENTS

#### Curriculum Step (Step 2)

- **Layout Fixes**:
    - Fixed button alignment and spacing issues
    - Added missing "Add Section" button with proper emerald-600 styling
    - Repositioned section chips below control panel (matching original design)
    - Improved responsive design with proper button sizing (`rounded-lg`)
- **Drag & Drop**:
    - Fixed persistence issues - changes now save correctly after swapping
    - Enhanced visual feedback during drag operations
- **Button Styling**:
    - Consistent button sizes and spacing
    - Proper word-wrapping prevention with `whitespace-nowrap`
    - Correct color scheme (emerald-600 for add button)

#### Article Editor Enhancements

- **Code Button**:
    - Fixed active state detection for inline code formatting
    - Added toggle functionality - click to add/remove code formatting
    - Proper styling with monospace font and background colors
- **Backtick Support**:
    - Added ` ` keyboard shortcut for inline code formatting
    - Smart cursor positioning between backticks
    - Selection wrapping functionality
- **Undo/Redo System**:
    - Custom history management (up to 50 states)
    - Replaced unreliable `document.execCommand` with custom implementation
    - Proper state tracking to prevent history loops
    - Visual feedback for available/unavailable actions

#### Course Info Step (Step 1)

- **Already Optimized**: Component was already well-structured and shared
- **Mode Awareness**: Proper handling of create vs edit modes
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive error handling and display
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts with Tailwind

### 📊 CODE REDUCTION & REUSE

- **~70% code reduction** compared to original components
- **Single source of truth** for all course builder logic
- **Eliminated duplicate code** between create and edit modes
- **Maintainable architecture** for future enhancements

### 🔄 TESTING & VALIDATION

- **Side-by-side testing**: Original and refactored components can be compared
- **Mode flexibility**: Shared components work for both create and edit operations
- **Complex state handling**: Edit mode complexity (dirty tracking, deletions) centralized
- **API integration**: Handles both create and update operations seamlessly
- **Identical UX**: Same validation, error handling, and navigation as original

### 🛡️ SAFETY GUARANTEES

- **No Breaking Changes**: Original components remain untouched
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Risk Mitigation**: Refactored components exist but aren't connected to routing yet
- **Safe Migration**: Clear path for production deployment

### 🎉 RESULTS

- **Unified Architecture**: All course builder steps now use shared components
- **Improved UX**: Better button alignment, code editing, drag & drop
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Centralized logic and reduced code duplication
